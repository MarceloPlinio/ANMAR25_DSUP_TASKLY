# üìù To-Do Compass API

This project involves the development of RESTful APIs for task management, encompassing the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of task cards and associated observations. The APIs will enable functionalities such as categorization, prioritization, advanced filters, and status control of tasks (Todo, In Progress, Done).
